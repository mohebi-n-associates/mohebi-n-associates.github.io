I'm a behavioral neuroscientist with a background in electrical engineering. I studied EE at Sharif University of Technology, University of Tehran, and Michigan State University before diving into behavioral neurobiology at Josh Berke's lab (University of Michigan and UCSF).

I'm fascinated by all aspects of systems neuroscience, from modeling neural circuits and cognitive processes to data analysis and experimental design. My research focuses on understanding how neuromodulatory signals—particularly dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin—shape learning and decision-making.

When I'm not immersed in research, I enjoy watching films, taking photos, baking, cooking, and listening to music. One day, I will learn how to play the Setar.
