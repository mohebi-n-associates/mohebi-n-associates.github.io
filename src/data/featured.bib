              predictions through experience. Transient increases in dopamine
              (DA) are thought to be critical signals for updating predictions.
              However, it is unclear how this mechanism handles a wide range of
              behavioral timescales-from seconds or less (for example, if
              singing a song) to potentially hours or more (for example, if
              hunting for food). Here we report that DA transients in distinct
              rat striatal subregions convey prediction errors based on distinct
              time horizons. DA dynamics systematically accelerated from ventral
              to dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum, in the tempo of
              spontaneous fluctuations, the temporal integration of prior
              rewards and the discounting of future rewards. This spectrum of
              timescales for evaluative computations can help achieve efficient
              learning and adaptive motivation for a broad range of behaviors.",

               nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for motivation to work for
               rewards and reward-driven learning. How dopamine supports both
               functions is unclear. Dopamine cell spiking can encode prediction
               errors, which are vital learning signals in computational
               theories of adaptive behaviour. By contrast, dopamine release
               ramps up as animals approach rewards, mirroring reward
               expectation. This mismatch might reflect differences in
               behavioural tasks, slower changes in dopamine cell spiking or
               spike-independent modulation of dopamine release. Here we compare
               spiking of identified VTA dopamine cells with NAc dopamine
               release in the same decision-making task. Cues that indicate an
               upcoming reward increased both spiking and release. However, NAc
               core dopamine release also covaried with dynamically evolving
               reward expectations, without corresponding changes in VTA
               dopamine cell spiking. Our results suggest a fundamental
               difference in how dopamine release is regulated to achieve
               distinct functions: broadcast burst signals promote learning,
               whereas local control drives motivation.",

               opportunity for discovery with fiber photometry has exploded with
               the development of an extensive range of fluorescent sensors for
               biomolecules including neuromodulators and peptides that were
               previously inaccessible in vivo. This critical advance, combined
               with the new availability of affordable ``plug-and-play''
               recording systems, has made monitoring molecules with high
               spatiotemporal precision during behavior highly accessible.
