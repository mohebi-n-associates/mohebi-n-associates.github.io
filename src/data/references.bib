               This debate is ongoing partly because the experimental conditions
               under which dopamine ramps emerge remain poorly understood. Here,
               we show that during Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning in
               mice, mesolimbic dopamine ramps are only observed when the
               inter-trial interval is short relative to the trial period. These
               results constrain theories of dopamine signaling and identify a
               critical variable determining the emergence of dopamine ramps.",

              dopamine in the striatum of mammals. Experiments in brain slices
              clearly show that synchronous activation of striatal cholinergic
              interneurons is sufficient to drive dopamine release via
              axo-axonal stimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.
              However, evidence for this mechanism in vivo has been less
              forthcoming. A recent paper in eLife (Mohebi et al., 2023)
              reported that, in awake behaving rats, optogenetic activation of
              striatal cholinergic interneurons with blue light readily evokes
              dopamine release measured with the red fluorescent sensor
              RdLight1. Here, we show that blue light alone alters the
              fluorescent properties of RdLight1 in a manner that may be
              misconstrued as phasic dopamine release, and that this artefactual
              photoactivation can account for the effects attributed to
              cholinergic interneurons. Our findings indicate that measurements
              of dopamine using the red-shifted fluorescent sensor RdLight1
              should be interpreted with caution when combined with
              optogenetics. In light of this and other publications that did not

              critical signal for updating predictions of future rewards.
              However, it is unclear how this mechanism handles the need to make
              predictions, and provide feedback, over multiple time horizons:
              from seconds or less (if singing a song) to potentially hours or
              more (if hunting for food). Here we report that dopamine pulses in
              distinct striatal subregions convey reward prediction errors over
              distinct temporal scales. Dopamine dynamics systematically
              accelerated from ventral to dorsal-medial to dorsal-lateral
              striatum, in the tempo of their spontaneous fluctuations, their
              integration of prior rewards, and their discounting of future
              rewards. This spectrum of time scales for value computations can
              help achieve efficient learning and adaptive motivation for a wide
              range of behaviors. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The

              meso-scale suggest the involvement of discrete oscillatory bursts
              as constructs of cognitive processing during behavioral tasks.
              Classical signal processing techniques that attempt to infer
              neural correlates of behavior from meso-scale activity employ
              spectral representations of the signal, exploiting power spectral
              density techniques and time-frequency (T-F) energy distributions
              to capture band power features. However, such analyses demand more
              specialized methods that incorporate explicitly the concepts of
              neurophysiological signal generation and time resolution in the
              tens of milliseconds. This paper focuses on working memory (WM), a
              complex cognitive process involved in encoding, storing and
              retrieving sensory information, which has been shown to be
              characterized by oscillatory bursts in the beta and gamma band.
              Employing a generative model for oscillatory dynamics, we present
              a marked point process (MPP) representation of bursts during
              memory creation and readout. We show that the markers of the point
              process quantify specific neural correlates of WM.Approach.We
              demonstrate our results on field potentials recorded from the
              prelimbic and secondary motor cortices of three rats while
              performing a WM task. The generative model for single channel,
              band-passed traces of field potentials characterizes with
              high-resolution, the timings and amplitudes of transient
              neuromodulations in the high gamma (80-150 Hz,γ) and beta (10-30
              Hz,β) bands as an MPP. We use standard hypothesis testing methods
              on the MPP features to check for significance in encoding of task
              variables, sensory stimulus and executive control while comparing
              encoding capabilities of our model with other T-F methods.Main
              Results.Firstly, the advantages of an MPP approach in deciphering
              encoding mechanisms at the meso-scale is demonstrated. Secondly,
              the nature of state encoding by neuromodulatory events is
              determined. Third, we demonstrate the necessity of a higher time
              resolution alternative to conventionally employed T-F methods.
              Finally, our results underscore the novelty in interpreting
              oscillatory dynamics encompassed by the marked features of the
              point process.Significance.An MPP representation of meso-scale
              activity not just enables a rich, high-resolution parameter space

               rewards and reward-driven learning. How dopamine supports both
               functions is unclear. Dopamine cell spiking can encode prediction
               errors, which are vital learning signals in computational
               theories of adaptive behaviour. By contrast, dopamine release
               ramps up as animals approach rewards, mirroring reward
               expectation. This mismatch might reflect differences in
               behavioural tasks, slower changes in dopamine cell spiking or
               spike-independent modulation of dopamine release. Here we compare
               spiking of identified VTA dopamine cells with NAc dopamine
               release in the same decision-making task. Cues that indicate an

               reward expectations, without corresponding changes in VTA

               difference in how dopamine release is regulated to achieve

              individual as well as the synergistic roles of single neurons in a
              recorded ensemble as they relate to an observed behavior. A
              mandatory step to achieve this goal is to sort spikes in an
              extracellularly recorded mixture that belong to individual neurons
              through feature extraction and clustering techniques. Here, we
              propose an approach for approximating the often nonlinear and time
              varying decision boundaries between spike-derived feature classes
              based on a simple, yet optimal thresholding mechanism. Because
              thresholding is a binary classifier, we show that the complex
              nonlinear decision boundaries required for spike class
              discrimination can be achieved by adequately fusing a set of weak
              binary classifiers. The thresholds for these binary classifiers
              are adaptively estimated through a learning algorithm that
              maximizes the separability between the sparsely represented
              classes. Based on our previous work, the approach substantially
              reduces the computational complexity of extracting, aligning and
              sorting multiple single unit activity early in the data stream.
              Here, we also show its ability to track changes in spike features
