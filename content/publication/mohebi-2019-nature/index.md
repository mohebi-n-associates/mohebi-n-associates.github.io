# Abstract
abstract: |
  Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to signal reward prediction errors 
  (RPEs), computed by subtracting expected from received rewards. However, 
  dopamine release in the striatum does not simply track RPEs—it also 
  correlates with anticipation of reward and with the vigor of movements 
  towards reward. Here we show that dopamine signals are dissociable across 
  brain regions...

# Summary for listing pages
summary: |
  We demonstrate that dopamine release in distinct brain regions serves 
  dissociable functions in learning versus motivation.

## Key Findings

1. **Regional dissociation**: Dopamine release patterns differ between ventral and dorsal striatum during motivated behavior

2. **Learning vs motivation**: Mesolimbic dopamine encodes reward prediction errors for learning, while nigrostriatal dopamine signals motivational state

3. **Local regulation**: Motivational dopamine signals appear to be locally regulated in terminal regions, independent of somatic firing

## Significance

This work challenges unified theories of dopamine function and reveals that the neuromodulatory logic of dopamine varies across brain circuits.
